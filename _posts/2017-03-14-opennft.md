# pyOpenNFT: An open-source Python framework for ML-based real-time fMRI and EEG-fMRI neurofeedback

pyOpenNFT is a fully Python-based pyOpenNFT framework was designed for greater flexibility, modularity,
and real-time processing efficiency. Its functionality was also extended with a ML-based prediction server for the fMRI NF signal using processed EEG records. 
The framework streamlines fMRI data acquisition and/or EEG-based prediction, NF signal estimation, and quality assessment (rtQA) without necessarily requiring a GUI. 
The FastAPI-based implementation for an EEG-based predictor integrates a Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) interface for processed EEG records and delivers real-time
predictions of fMRI time-series for target brain regions. The system supports the visualization of additional NF sources by querying a RESTful interface, facilitating interoperability with external applications.

# An open-source Python/Matlab framework for real-time fMRI neurofeedback training

OpenNFT is a GUI-based multi-processing open-source software package for real-time fMRI neurofeedback training and quality assessment. 
This package is based on best practices of the platform-independent interpreted programming languages Python and Matlab to facilitate 
concurrent functionality, high modularity, and the ability to extend the software in Python or Matlab depending on end-user preferences. 
OpenNFT includes, but is not limited to, the functionality of SPM, PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox software suits. The OpenNFT’s GUI, 
synchronization module and multi-processing core are implemented in Python, whilst computational modules for real-time data processing 
and neurofeedback are implemented in Matlab.
