# An open-source Python/Matlab framework for real-time fMRI neurofeedback training

OpenNFT is a GUI-based multi-processing open-source software package for real-time fMRI neurofeedback training and quality assessment. 
This package is based on best practices of the platform-independent interpreted programming languages Python and Matlab to facilitate 
concurrent functionality, high modularity, and the ability to extend the software in Python or Matlab depending on end-user preferences. 
OpenNFT includes, but is not limited to, the functionality of SPM, PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox software suits. The OpenNFT’s GUI, 
synchronization module and multi-processing core are implemented in Python, whilst computational modules for real-time data processing 
and neurofeedback are implemented in Matlab.
