## Installation and Documentation

## Required end-user skills

Our software is made so that the variety of neurofeedback researches and implementations could be addressed by the end-user with Matlab programming skills only, not necessarily experienced with Python and multi-processing programming.
An end-user who targets the full flexibility on software modifications requires solid programming skills and/or an engineering background being familiar with Matlab and Python programming practices and multi-processing programming.

Solid knowledge in fMRI data processing and neurofeedback is required to understand the data processing and neurofeedback logic.

Our team can assist the variety of issues from installation procedures, to computational algorithms, neurofeedback project design, data analysis and software customizations for end-user needs.
